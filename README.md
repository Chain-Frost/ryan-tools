Still plenty more tidy up to do

Cleaning up and improving scripts as they are used again

Somewhat working:

# TUFLOW
* POMM and 1d max file parsing collections
* TUFLOW culverts merge
* TUFLOW POMM
* TUFLOW logsummary from .tlf files
* set_layer_to_filename: rename  gpkg file to single internal layer name


# RORB
* hydrograph to closure time - but not pretty

# 12D
* tif to csv or las in tiles
* culverts - partial, but still a bunch to do and test

# GDAL python
* pretty dodgy, but I think v9 was safe

# GDAL bat
* also pretty dodgy

Lots of others at varying levels of quality.


Pretty much no tests.
