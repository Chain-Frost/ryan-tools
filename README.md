Cleaning up and improving scripts as they are used again

## Automation Support

This repository is configured for automated pull requests generated by tools such as ChatGPT Codex.
The pull request template at `.github/pull_request_template.md` captures the required summary,
testing commands, and checklists so that automated agents provide consistent information. Keep the
template up to date when workflows change to ensure the automation continues to produce useful PRs.

Automated code reviews by Codex should follow `.github/code_review_instructions.md`, which documents
the repository structure, review checklist, and feedback expectations. Update the guide when review
patterns change so that automated reviewers stay aligned with human preferences.

Somewhat working:

# TUFLOW
* POMM and 1d max file parsing collections
* TUFLOW culverts merge
* TUFLOW POMM
* TUFLOW logsummary from .tlf files
* set_layer_to_filename: rename  gpkg file to single internal layer name


# RORB
* hydrograph to closure time - but not pretty

# 12D
* tif to csv or las in tiles
* culverts - partial, but still a bunch to do and test

# GDAL python
* pretty dodgy, but I think v9 was safe

# GDAL bat
* also pretty dodgy

Lots of others at varying levels of quality.


Pretty much no tests.
