# TUFLOW Python wrappers

This folder contains maintained, library-backed wrappers as well as older
standalone utilities. New and updated thin wrappers follow the repository-wide
[`WRAPPER_STANDARD.md`](../WRAPPER_STANDARD.md); versioned standalone scripts
retain their own self-contained behaviour until they are deliberately migrated.

## Maintained wrappers

The maintained wrappers delegate processing to `ryan_library` orchestrators and
keep editable project paths, globs, filters, output modes and thresholds near
the top of each file. This includes the log-summary, POMM/PO combination,
culvert reporting, time-series checking, result styling and ASC_to_ASC search
wrappers.

[`plot_water_level_profiles.py`](plot_water_level_profiles.py) creates terrain
and TUFLOW water-level profile PNGs along GeoPackage lines.  CLI arguments can override paths and profile settings. The workflow validates CRS metadata and
requires exactly one result raster for every requested AEP. Missing CRS metadata
is inferred from any tagged profile or raster input; when every input is
untagged, their source coordinates are assumed to already align.
The default masked-bilinear sampler returns NoData only when the profile
station's containing raster cell is NoData; adjacent NoData cells are excluded
and the remaining interpolation weights are renormalised.

Only imports needed to construct or annotate those editable values, such as
`Path` and `Literal`, appear before the settings. Operational third-party and
`ryan_library` imports follow the editable block so users see configuration
before implementation wiring.

Each maintained wrapper embeds a `WRAPPER_VERSION` that remains available when
the file is copied into a job folder. At both the start and end of processing it
prints:

```python
print_wrapper_banner(wrapper_file=Path(__file__), wrapper_version=WRAPPER_VERSION)
```

The closing call sets `leading_blank_line=True` so the completion banner is
visually separated from processing output without repeating three statements
in every wrapper.

The wrapper version identifies the copied entry-point file; the separately
installed `ryan_functions` version identifies the shared implementation.
Interactive completion uses `pause_console()`, which collects unreachable
Python objects immediately before waiting. Redirected/headless runs do not
pause, and `--no-pause` explicitly disables the wait for automation.

## Shared command-line arguments

Common `argparse` declarations live in
`ryan_library.functions.wrapper_utils` so wrappers do not repeat boilerplate:

| Helper | Arguments added |
| --- | --- |
| `add_execution_cli_arguments()` | `--working-directory`, `--console-log-level`, `--no-pause` |
| `add_filter_cli_arguments()` | `--data-types`, `--locations` |
| `add_live_dashboard_cli_arguments()` | Dashboard enable/disable, refresh rate and maximum rows |
| `add_common_cli_arguments()` | All three groups above |
| `add_export_mode_cli_argument()` | `--export-mode {excel,parquet,both}` |

`parse_common_cli_arguments()` converts the resulting `argparse.Namespace` to
the typed `CommonWrapperOptions` object. A wrapper should select only the groups
its workflow supports, then declare specialised options locally. For example,
ASC_to_ASC worker, dry-run and strictness options remain in those wrappers
because their meaning and help text are workflow-specific.

Run any maintained wrapper with `--help` for its current arguments. For a
headless invocation, include `--no-pause`:

```powershell
py -3.14 .\LogSummary.py --working-directory "D:\Model\results" --no-pause
py -3.14 .\POMM_combine.py --export-mode parquet --no-pause
```

## POMM peak wrapper migration

The maintained mean and median POMM peak wrappers call
`ryan_library.orchestrators.tuflow.pomm_max_items` directly. Older copied
wrappers that use `PommPeakWrapperDefaults` and
`run_pomm_peak_report_wrapper()` from `wrapper_utils` remain supported, with a
deprecation warning, until 31 December 2026. Replace those copied wrappers with
the maintained versions before that date.
