GIS Format == GPKG                                  ! Specify GPKG as the output format for all GIS files
GPKG Projection == ..\model\gis\Projection.gpkg     ! Sets the GIS projection for the TUFLOW Model
TIF Projection == ..\model\grid\DEM.tif             ! Sets the GIS projection for the ouput grid files
! Write Empty GIS Files == ..\model\gis\empty		! Creates template GIS layers, commented out as files were already created

! SOLUTION SCHEME
Solution Scheme == HPC                              ! Heavily Parallelised Compute, uses adaptive timestepping
Hardware == GPU                                     ! Comment out if GPU card is not available or replace with "Hardware == CPU"
SGS == ON                                           ! Switches on Sub-Grid Sampling
SGS Sample Target Distance == 0.5                   ! Sets SGS Sample Target Distance to 0.5m

! TIME CONTROL
Timestep == 1                                       ! Specifies the first 2D computational timestep of 1 second
Start Time == 0                                     ! Specifies a simulation start time of 0 hours
End Time == 3                                       ! Specifies a simulation end time of 3 hours

! OUTPUT FOLDERS
Log Folder == log                                   ! Location of the log output files (e.g. .tlf and _messages files)
Output Folder == ..\results\                        ! Location of the 2D output files and prefixes them with the .tcf filename
Write Check Files == ..\check\                      ! Location of the 2D check files and prefixes them with the .tcf filename

! OUTPUT SETTINGS
Map Output Format == XMDF TIF                       ! Result file types
Map Output Data Types == h V d dt                   ! Outputs water levels, velocities, depths, minimum timestep
Map Output Interval == 300                          ! Outputs map data every 300 seconds (5 minutes)
TIF Map Output Interval == 0                        ! Outputs only maximums for grids

! TIME SERIES PLOT OUTPUT
